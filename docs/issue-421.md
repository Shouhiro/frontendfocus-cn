*来源：🚀 To close out the year, this week we're looking back over the past twelve months and linking to some of the top articles, stories, and tutorials that we've shared and that you've clicked on the most. Consider this the highlights reel of all things frontend in 2019. (_Oh, and we also have our usual Tip of the Week at the end of the issue so be sure to scroll down for that_).*

#### As ever, a big thanks for supporting us and reading the newsletter throughout the year

and we look forward to keeping you up-to-date in the next decade! We'll be back with our next roundup in early January.

*来源：📈 **Our most popular links of 2019:***

#### 1. [The Front-End Developer Handbook 2019](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81422/rss "frontendmasters.com")

This detailed guide always proves popular, and this year was no different. This resource was updated back in April and is packed with useful resources, learning materials and dev tools. It remains a worthwhile reference.

#### 2. [10 HTML Elements You Didn't Know You Needed](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81423/rss "dev.to")

This quick look at a handful of HTML elements highlights some stuff you may not have known existed, including the `<output>`, `<meter>`, and `<progress>` tags.

#### 3. [Inside Microsoft’s Surprise Decision to Work with Google on its Edge Browser](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81436/rss "www.theverge.com")

One of the biggest surprises in the browser landscape this year was **Microsoft's decision to switch over to using Chromium as the engine behind their Edge browser.** This inside story behind the how and why of such a "monumental decision" got plenty of attention. The first 'full release' of [this new browser is expected in early 2020](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81437/rss).

#### 4. [The Great Divide in Front-End Development Skills](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81430/rss "css-tricks.com")

Published back in January, this interesting think piece shares what Chris Coyier (_of CSS-Tricks fame_) perceives as a widening gulf between different types of frontend devs. Is there such a thing as a frontend developer or are we all moving towards becoming either UX engineers or JavaScript developers?

#### 5. [The State of CSS 2019](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81438/rss)

The results from the first ever 'State of CSS' survey dropped in June. It asked over 10,000 developers what CSS features and tools they favoured. It's still worth digging into all the data, as you'll gain a broad awareness of what people are using in practice as CSS evolves.

#### 6. [W3C Approved WebAuthn as the Web Standard for Password-Free Logins](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81425/rss "venturebeat.com")

Back in March the W3C shared news that the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) had become an official web standard for password-free logins on the web. Since then support for the security-focused standard has only been growing, with browsers such as [Safari](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81426/rss) and [Firefox](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81427/rss), and big names like [Twitter](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81428/rss) and [eBay](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81429/rss) all adding support.

#### 7. [A Front-End Performance Checklist for 2019](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81431/rss "www.smashingmagazine.com")

Another from January. This checklist has been publishing for several years now and was updated once again with fresh advice for 2019 (_I'd imagine we'll probably see a 2020 update in a few weeks_). It highlights issues you might need to consider to ensure that response times are fast, user interaction is smooth and your sites don’t drain bandwidth. It's also available in a 'tickable' [PDF format](https://frontendfoc.us/link/81432/rss).
